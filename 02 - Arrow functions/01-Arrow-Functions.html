    const names = ['wes', 'kait', 'lux'];

    // Say you want to add 'bos' as a last name to each of these names.
    // Normally you would use .map();
    const coolNames = names.map(function(name) {
      return `${name} Bos`;
    });

    // How would we re-write this as an arrow function?
    // Let's re-write the above as an arrow function
    // 1. Replace the word 'function' with a fat arrow
    const coolNames2 = names.map((name) => {
      return `${name} Bos`;
    });

    // 2. If you only have one parameter, (i.e. 'name'), there's no need to have parenthesis around it
    const coolNames3 = names.map(name => {
      return `${name} Bos`;
    });

    // 3. You can also utilize the arrow function's implicit return
    // An explicit return = writing out the word "return"
    // Write an implicit return by putting the return statement on the same line as the arrow, and deleting the external curly brackets
    const coolNames4 = names.map(name => `${name} Bos`);

    // 4. If you aren't passing an argument at all, you need to pass in a set of empty parenthesis
    const coolNames5 = names.map(() => `cool cool joey`);

    // console.log(coolNames5);
    // By their nature, arrow functions are always anonymous functions.
    // You can, however, store the function in a variable.
    
    const sayMyName = (name) => { console.log(`Hey there ${name}!`) };

    sayMyName('joey');
