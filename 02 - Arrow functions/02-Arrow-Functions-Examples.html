  const race = '100m Dash';
  const winners = ['Hunter Gath', 'Singa Song', 'Imda Bos'];

  // We can use an arrow function to build an object like:
  // racer = {
  //   name: 'Joey Reyes',
  //   place: 1,
  //   race: race
  // }
  
  // 1. Use the arrow function's implicit return, but return an object. (Hint, use parenthesis);
  const racers = winners.map((winner, i) => ({name: winner, race: race, place: i + 1}));

  // 2. A new feature of es6 is that you can get rid of that redundant 'race: race' and it will still work:
  const racers2 = winners.map((winner, i) => ({namne: winner, race, place: i + 1}));

  // console.table(racers2);
  // Now let's poll the people in the room for their ages
  const ages = [10, 16, 55, 2234, 63, 909, 23, 23];

  // Now let's filter the list for people who are 60 years or older
  const oldPeople = ages.filter(age => age >= 60);
  console.log(oldPeople);
